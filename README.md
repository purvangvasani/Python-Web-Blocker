# Python-Web-Blocker

This website blocker is a simple python script which will run in the background process and blocks all the websites during your working hours.

Add website name in the script and run the script using: python3.8 blocker.py

Note: 
    1. This script is currently for Linux & Mac system only (for windows, I will make change and commit soon).
    2. If you do not have python environent in your machine then maybe this will not work.
    3. Currently you have to run this script manually everytime when you start your work which is not a good process. I will add the steps in future through which          the script will starts when your machine reboots.
